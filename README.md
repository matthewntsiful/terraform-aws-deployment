This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying a multi-environment AWS infrastructure. The deployment is structured to support development, staging, and production environments with separate state files and configurations for each.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-environment Support**: Separate configurations for dev, staging, and prod environments
- **Modular Design**: Reusable Terraform modules for consistent infrastructure
- **Secure State Management**: Remote state storage with proper access controls
- **CI/CD Ready**: Designed for integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure definitions

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0.0
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS account with necessary permissions
- SSH key pair for EC2 instance access

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewntsiful/terraform-aws-deployment.git
cd terraform-aws-deployment
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and update with your values:

```bash
cp environments/dev/terraform.tfvars.example environments/dev/terraform.tfvars
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

Navigate to the desired environment directory and initialize Terraform:

```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform init
```

### 4. Plan and Apply

Review the execution plan and apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Environment Configuration

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own configuration in the `environments` directory. The main differences between environments are:

- **Development**: Lower resource limits, more verbose logging
- **Staging**: Mirrors production with reduced scale
- **Production**: Full-scale deployment with production-grade settings

## Module Usage

This deployment uses the following modules from the `terraform-aws-modules` repository:

- **VPC**: Network infrastructure including subnets, route tables, and NAT gateways
- **EC2**: Compute instances with auto-scaling groups
- **Security Groups**: Network access controls
- **RDS**: Managed database instances
- **ALB**: Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

## Managing State

Each environment maintains its own remote state file in an S3 bucket with state locking via DynamoDB. The backend configuration is defined in `backend.tf`.

## Security

- IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege
- Sensitive values are managed using Terraform's sensitive variables
- All resources are tagged appropriately for cost allocation and management

## Contributing
